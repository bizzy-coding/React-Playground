# React Learning

This repository is a personal space for staying sharp and exploring key concepts in React. From foundational patterns to small component experiments, it's where I revisit, practise, and build on core ideas in modern front-end development.

Whether it's refreshing syntax, experimenting with hooks, or testing UI logic in isolation, this project helps me keep my React skills fresh outside of day-to-day client work.
